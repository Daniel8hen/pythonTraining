#Motive - it's not a good practice to have all functions, but only those needed.
# therefore, we need to import some code before starting usage
# we can import modules and os's, module are more likely libraries
# library - .py files
# import sqlite3;
# dir(sqlite3)
# print(dir(sqlite3))
# print(os.__file__
# we can use pip from the terminal and install other modules / libraries
# package, module, library - all are actually the same (bunch of code from an external service)
import glob2
print(glob2.glob("*.txt"))
